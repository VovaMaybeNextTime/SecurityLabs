The meaning of the solution is that we enter a word or words for the action of xor and hope to find more familiar words (symbols) in one of the lines received. 
Thus, when we enter more characters for xor, we get better output and can find out where the text is from. 
Also, when we enter the longest string for ksora, we will get the decrypted entire text.

The sequence of finding words: 
1) The ("the" with space, 4 symbols). 
2) Than ("than" with space, 5 symbols). 
3) With a ("with" with space, "a" and space, 7 symbols).
4) Next, we found the line "And thuF", we assume that there is "s" instead of "F" and we perform decryption with the line "And thus "(9 symbols).
5) "And enter" – we check again 9 symbols, since we are not sure whether the word ends with this.
6) "And makes " – 10 symbols.
7) Next, we found the line "And enterp", we assume that there is "And enterprise" – 14 symbols.
8) Next, we found the line "Thus conscienc", we assume that there is "Thus conscience " – 16 symbols.
9) "Than fly to othe", we assume that it is encrypted there "Than fly to other" – 17 symbols.
10) At this stage, the beginning of each line becomes clear and you can simply google this text. Xor 12 with other lines (counting from 0),
gave us an answer to the question, what is this text.
It turned out to be an excerpt from Hamlet.
