In total, I have created 1,000,000 passwords. 
Among them, 4 variants of passwords were used. 
The first 100,000 passwords were taken from the top 100 passwords, 800,000 were taken from the top 100,000 passwords, 
50,000 were generated with a random generator and the remaining 50,000 were generated with my near human password generator. 
For random passwords, a length of 7 characters was used, since, according to statistics, a person can remember from 5 to 9 characters. 
About a human generator was created on the basis of 10 words that people call me, 10 of my favorite numbers, 10 cool adjectives, 
10 random numbers in the range from 60 to 100 and thirteen symbols that correspond to the name of playing cards from ace (A) to two (2 ).
