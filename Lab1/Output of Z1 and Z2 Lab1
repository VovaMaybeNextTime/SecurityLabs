Now try a repeating-key XOR cipher. E.g. it should take a string âhello worldâ and, 
given the key is âkeyâ, xor the first letter âhâ with âkâ, then xor âeâ with âeâ, then âlâ with âyâ, 
and then xor next char âlâ with âkâ again, then âoâ with âeâ and so on. You may use an index of coincidence, 
Hamming distance, Kasiski examination, statistical tests or whatever method you feel would show the best result.



Write a code to attack some simple substitution cipher. To reduce the complexity of this one we will use only uppercase letters, 
so the keyspace is only 26! To get this one right automatically you will probably need to use some sort of genetic algorithm 
(which worked the best last year), simulated annealing or gradient descent. Seriously, write it right now, 
you will need it to decipher the next one as well. Bear in mind, there's no spaces.
